# AbsoluteC++

This is a repository for storing my code while reading the book [Absolute C++ (5Th Edition)](https://github.com/nnbaokhuong/CSBooks/blob/master/Absolute%20C%2B%2B%20FIFTH%20EDITION%20Walter%20Savitch.pdf) by [Walter Savitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Savitch).

Im very new to C++ so you might find alot of comments, Im also most familiar with TypeScript so you might find some of the code is written in TypeScript to compare with C++.
